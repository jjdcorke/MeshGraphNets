# MeshGraphNets
PHYS 449 course project. In this repository, we attempt replication of results of the Learning Mesh Based Simulations with Graph Networks paper from deepmind's research team. We specifically replicate the flag simple and cylindrical flow experiments. Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03409
